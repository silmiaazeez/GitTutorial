 libvirt (KVM/QEMU)
Steps:

    Create the VM (if you haven't already):

    bash

    virt-install \
    --name=MyVM \
    --ram=2048 \
    --vcpus=2 \
    --os-variant=ubuntu20.04 \
    --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/MyVM.qcow2,size=20 \
    --cdrom=/path/to/os.iso \
    --network network=default \
    --graphics vnc

        --cdrom: Path to the ISO image of the guest OS.
        --disk: Path and size of the virtual hard drive.

    Connect to the VM using VNC: Once the installation begins, you can connect to the VM via VNC (if --graphics vnc is used) or open the installation process via virt-manager for a graphical interface.

    Proceed with Guest OS Installation: Follow the prompts within the guest OS installer.

Common Steps Across Platforms:

    Once the VM starts, it will boot from the ISO file (the installation media for your chosen OS).
    Proceed with the installation of the OS by following the on-screen prompts, just like you would on a physical machine.
    After installation, remove the ISO from the VMâ€™s virtual CD/DVD drive to ensure that the VM boots from the hard disk.
