libvirt (KVM/QEMU)

To take a snapshot using virsh with KVM/QEMU:

    Take a live snapshot:

    bash

virsh snapshot-create-as --domain VM_Name "Snapshot_Name" \
--description "Snapshot description" --disk-only --atomic

    VM_Name: The name of your virtual machine.
    Snapshot_Name: A name for the snapshot.
    --disk-only: Snapshot only the VM's disk image, without memory state (use --memspec to include memory if needed).
    --atomic: Ensures the snapshot is atomic, meaning it either succeeds entirely or fails without partial changes.

List snapshots (optional):

bash

    virsh snapshot-list VM_Name

Common Snapshot Concepts:

    Snapshot: A snapshot saves the VM's disk state and, optionally, the memory state. It allows you to revert the VM to the exact point when the snapshot was taken.
    Live Snapshot: This is a snapshot taken while the VM is running, capturing its current state without shutting it down.
