Cloning a virtual machine (VM) using libvirt and KVM/QEMU allows you to create an identical copy of an existing VM. You can clone the VM while it's shut down or even while it's running, depending on your needs.

Here's how to clone a VM using virsh, which is the command-line interface for managing KVM-based virtual machines.
1. Prerequisites

Before cloning, ensure the following:

    The original VM (source) should either be shut down or in a suspended state.
    Make sure you have enough storage space to accommodate the cloned VM.

2. Basic VM Cloning Command

The basic command to clone a VM using virsh is as follows:

bash

virsh clone --original Original_VM_Name --name New_VM_Name --file /path/to/new/disk.qcow2

    --original: The name of the VM you want to clone (source VM).
    --name: The name for the new VM (clone).
    --file: The path where the new VM’s disk image will be stored. This should not overwrite the original VM's disk.

3. Step-by-Step Guide to Cloning
Step 1: List Available VMs

Check the name of the VM you want to clone:

bash

virsh list --all

Step 2: Shutdown or Suspend the Source VM

If the source VM is running, shut it down or suspend it before cloning. To shut down:

bash

virsh shutdown Original_VM_Name

Alternatively, to suspend the VM:

bash

virsh suspend Original_VM_Name

Step 3: Clone the VM

Now you can clone the VM with the following command:

bash

virsh clone --original Original_VM_Name --name New_VM_Name --file /var/lib/libvirt/images/New_VM_Disk.qcow2

    Replace Original_VM_Name with the name of your source VM.
    Replace New_VM_Name with the name of the clone.
    Replace /var/lib/libvirt/images/New_VM_Disk.qcow2 with the path where you want to save the disk of the cloned VM.

Step 4: Verify the Clone

To verify that the VM has been cloned successfully:

bash

virsh list --all

You should see both the original VM and the cloned VM listed.
Step 5: Edit the Clone’s Configuration (Optional)

After cloning, you may want to adjust the network configuration, MAC address, or other settings to avoid conflicts between the original and cloned VMs. To edit the new VM’s XML configuration:

bash

virsh edit New_VM_Name

4. Cloning with Full Disk Image

If you want to clone the VM including its complete disk state:

bash

virt-clone --original Original_VM_Name --name New_VM_Name --file /path/to/new_disk.qcow2

    virt-clone is a wrapper command for VM cloning that provides more options for disk cloning.

5. Running the Cloned VM

After cloning, you can start the cloned VM using:

bash

virsh start New_VM_Name

6. Additional Options

    MAC Address: By default, virsh will generate a new MAC address for the cloned VM, but you can manually specify it using the --mac option:

    bash

    virsh clone --original Original_VM_Name --name New_VM_Name --file /path/to/new/disk.qcow2 --mac 52:54:00:12:34:56

    Memory and CPU Settings: You can also change memory and CPU settings of the clone during cloning by manually editing the XML configuration after the clone is created.

Conclusion

Cloning a VM with libvirt and KVM/QEMU using virsh or virt-clone is a straightforward process. Just ensure that the original VM is shut down or suspended before starting, and adjust the necessary configurations for the cloned VM to avoid conflicts with the original.
